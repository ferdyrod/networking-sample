To update the checksum in Package.swift:

1. Generate the SHA-256 checksum of the framework zip file:
   - On macOS/Linux: shasum -a 256 networking.xcframework.zip
   - On Windows: certutil -hashfile networking.xcframework.zip SHA256
   
2. Replace the placeholder checksum in Package.swift with the generated value

Current URL: https://github.com/kotlin/allfunds-networking/releases/download/v1.0.0/networking.xcframework.zip

Note: After creating a new release on GitHub, you need to:
1. Upload the networking.xcframework.zip file to the release
2. Update the version number in the URL if necessary
3. Update the checksum with the new value

The placeholder checksum (all zeros) must be replaced with the actual SHA-256 checksum
before the Swift package can be used in a real project.
